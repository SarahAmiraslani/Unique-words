Beginning at its circumference, there exists an event horizon where light and matter that passes through this event horizon can no longer escape the gravity of a black hole. Black holes typically form in two ways. One, they form from the supernova of a star. As the star collapses in on itself, the star becomes so dense that it forms a black hole. Two, they form from the collision of neutron stars. If the combined mass of the neutron stars is greater than 3 solar masses, the stars collide/collapse to form a black hole.The size or Schwarzberg's radius of the black hole is dependent on the mass of the black hole. As the mass increases, the size of black hole increases. Additionally, the greater the mass of the black hole, the greater the black hole warps spacetime. As objects approach the black hole / pass through the event horizon, relative time for them slows down.At the singularity, time is practically at a standstill. Space is nearly infinitely dense.

As you approach the center of the black hole, time slows. Therefore, someone observing you approach the center will observe you moving slower and/or standing still.

      " A black hole is a region in space where nothing that enters can ever return. It is called \"black\" because of the absence of light, and \"hole\" because items that enter cannot return. They are created when stars explode or collide. The reason that items cannot be recovered from a black hole is that it would require something to be faster than the speed of light to escape, which is impossible. Contrary to popular belief, however, black holes do not have a large amount of energy pulling things in to themselves. Black holes can only pull in items that are close to the radius at which it impossible to escape. A radius of a black hole is called a Schwarz... radius: it is calculated from assuming flat space-time, not curved/warped as it is in reality.  Black holes form either when stars explode (supernovas) or collide, causing a disruption in space-time continuum. How large a black hole is when it forms depends on the original mass of the star(s) involved. Black holes have three main properties: mass, time, and electro... force. Mass is relevant because the radius of a black hole is relative to its original mass. Time is also a property because time slows the further in to the black hole you get. Space and time don't exist as we understand them in a black hole (they are four dimensional). We cannot ever know exactly what it is like in the center of a black hole, however.  \n",

      " A black hole is a super massive \"star\", or \"thing\", in the universe, that has very little, or no volume. It's gravity is so huge within such a tiny space, that the space-time becomes so curved (according to general relativity) that even light cannot escape from it (inside the event horizon).Black holes come from the concentration of very great mass within a small space, and such event may be the result of supernova and the following collapse, or of 2 collided neutron stars that have total mass greater then 3 suns.The only three properties meaningful for a black hole are mass, charge, and rotation. A black hole's gravity (e.g. influence on other things around it) and event horizon depends on its mass. A black hole may have positive or negative charges, but since if so it would absorb electric charges from the space, we predict that we could not find a charged black hole. Rotation comes from the collided neutron stars when they rotated and got closer and closer to each other, and the total angular momentum remains constant overall.According to general relativity, space-time becomes super curved inside a black hole. According to quantum physics, space and time become \"chaos\", and every physical law we know about space and time becomes ineffective there. Currently we don't have any evidence because it's impossible for us to send something across the event horizon and get information as it comes back - nothing can escape. \n",

      " A black hole is an object that forms due to either the collapse of a large supernova, or the combination of two neutron stars. A black hole has a gravitation pull so strong that even light cannot escape. This is why they are termed black holes. Black holes have an infinite radius that breaks through the spacetime fabric. There are three important properties of a black hole which are the event horizon, the radius and point of singularity.  The mass and radius of the black hole is determined by the mass of the star it used to be. When an object enters a black hole, it will appear that time is slowing down from the reference point of an observer since the inside of a black hole does not follow our classical understandment of time and space. The only way that an object could possibly escape a black hole if it was moving at an even faster velocity than the speed of light, which so far is impossible to surpass. That is why beyond the event horizon, our understanding of how time and space work is best explained by Einstein's theory of relativity. To this day it is still uncertain whether black holes do exist but we can examine their effects in astronomy such as by studying two binary stars and so forth. Black Holes form from the collapse of the iron core of a supernova and can also form if two neutron stars of a combining mass exceeding 10 to 29 solar masses. The collapse is due to the electron degeneracy effect weakening and hence the stars metal core can no longer be supported. Once the iron core starts to collapse, there is no way to stop the processes since there is currently nothing strong enough to stop it. The radius of the black hole is determined by the mass of the star / stars that they were once. Some relevant properties of a black hole is radiation, its radius and mass. The radius of a black hole is determined by the mass of the star that collapsed. Even though we cannot actually measure the radius of a black hole since it is infinite. We can instead measure the distance from the event horizon to the supposed center of a black hole. Black holes have a large mass so that is why they have a very big gravitational pull. A misconception is that because black holes have a large gravitation pull, that they behave like vacuums that suck everything in their path, but that is not the case. In fact it is rather difficult to accidentally slip into a black hole. Space and time do not behave the same at the singularity of a black hole. In the diagram that we were shown, if we had two spacecrafts near the black hole and one starts to move towards the center of the black hole, it would appear that the spacecraft approaching its center is slowing down. Time and space do not behave like how it does in the observable universe because a black hole is so dense that it creates a hole in the spacetime fabric. The behavior inside a black hole and be somewhat explained by Einsteins theory of relativity because we are dealing with circumstances outside of classical mechanics. The theory of relativity helps us get a better understandment of how objects would behave if they are traveling at speeds faster than light which would be the case in the inside of a black hole.  \n",

It is fairly hard to fall into a black hole and an object can only enter it after getting very close to the event horizon, or the point at which we say the black hole \"begins\" and the rest of the universe \"ends.\" However, it is impossible to escape from a black hole because the escape velocity is the same as the speed of light, and nothing travels faster than that.

We cannot find any information on the contents or origins of a black hole by observing it.

The author said that charge should more or less be ignored since a charged black hole would just attract more objects of the opposite charge and would therefore neutralize itself.

      " A black hole is formed when a large star collapse due to their iron core unable to stablize the ions surrounding the core and eventually collapse and become a supernova explosion. During this explosion the mass of the star are separated into neurons. When two or more of these neurons collide in a particularly small space, it creates a black hole. This black hole forms with angular motions as it spins when created, this also create indefinite gravity force that sucks everything else within the event horizon, which is an imaginary boundary around the blackhole. If there is any matter than enters into the event horizon, it will require the escape velocity, which is the amount of force that the matter needs to escape from the suction of the black hole, that has to be faster than the speed of light in order to escape. In other words, any matter once enter the event horizon is unable to escape and will eventually sucks into the black hole. If one is looking at a matter being suck into the blackhole, one will notice the matter is slowing down and even appear to freeze the closer the matter gets to the center of the black hole. This is because of the four dimension of the black hole that indefinitely expands spacetime that causes the person watching this matter to appear to slow down and freeze and eventually disappear into the black hole. Blackholes formed when there is a large star collapse as its iron core is no longer able to hold in the ions surrounding it and caused a supernova explosion. After the explosion, the mass of the star becomes neurons. When there is two or more neurons collapse into each other in a particularly small space, this will create a black hole. When the black hole is formed, there is an angular motion as it is formed and therefore create a suction to the surrounding. The three properties of the black hole is mass, charge and also angular motion. As mentioned above, black hole is formed through an supernova explosion of the star and eventually turning the mass of the star into neurons. The supernova explosion is formed because the iron core in the center of the star is no longer able to hold the ions and the charges become unstable. When there are two or more neurons collide with each other in a particularly small space, it will creates a black hole with the angular motion. This will then become a suction of other matters that enters in to the event horizon. There are two theories in regarding the singularity of the black hole. Einstein's theory is that since gravity is found to be true based on space and time, then black hole's space and time will be infinitely expands and therefore it explains how matters are sucked into them. The other theory mentioned that singulariy is caused because of the four dimension expansion of spacetime which explains it is almost impossible through observable methods to measure the size of the black hole or even the physical properties of the black hole.  \n",

      " A black hole is where not even light can escape. It has an event horizon which is a boundary between the inside and the outside of a black hole, and we don't know what the behavior inside the black hole is like. As something approaches the event horizon, time slows down to the point that if an outside was looking at an object in the event horizon while moving, it would appear as if that object were frozen because it is moving at an astronomically slower rate compared to the object outside of the event horizon. We measure how big it is by looking at the black hole's Scwharzchild radius.  Once something goes inside of a black hole, it is gone forever and does not appear again. Also, it does not act like a vacuum which the majority of people believe, it is actually very difficult for something to fall inside of a black hole and the object would have to be really close to the event horizon.  A black hole has three properties: mass, charge, and angular momentum. The escape velocity of a black hole would have to be faster than the speed of light which is impossible, this is why nothing can escape it.Black holes form when the core of a large star collapses once the gravitational pull exceeds 3 solar masses. Often times, we don't know where a black hole comes from because it can occur due to a few circumstances.  I don't remember how to describe anything else.The three properties of a black hole are mass, charge, and angular momentum. I don't remember much about the exact details related to this properties, but I think it said the charge does not really have an effect in the black hole or doesn't really matter.Space and time are infinitely stretched at the singularity of a black hole, and it looks like a four dimensional grid.

The charge determine what get suck into the black hole, this property is inherited from the supernova and the how the black hole is form. The angular momentum also depends on the supernova or neutron stars. Angular momentum must be conserved, so depending on at what angular speed the supernova and neutron stars is spinning at, the black hole should do the same. The space and time at the singularity of a black hole is very different. For example, time. Time will be different from us. The time beyond horizon and our time passes at different pace.

When two of these neural atom groups combine together, they can create a black hole. A black hole does not actually suck things into them like a vacuum, but things can fall into them. The point at which item can fall into a black hole is called the horizon event. Black holes form from the combustion of supernova stars. When a star combusts, its core has little neuron atoms that then bunch together to form groups. If two of these groups then combine, a black hole may be formed. Black holes can have an infinite radius. It is impossible to know what has entered a black hole because it is like exiting the universe to the other side. A thing would have to travel faster than the speed of light, which is impossible, to escape from a black hole. They are not like vacuums and do not suck up things around them. They are always spinning.At the singularity of the black hole, from an outsider's perspective, time would seem really slow.

      " A black hole is a phenomena that occurs when the iron core of a supernova explosion occurs and collapses. Though that is not the only circumstance in which a black hole can form. It can also occur when two neutron stars collide. It is one of the most difficult phenomena to understand in physics. As I stated above, a black hole can form when the iron core of a supernova explosion happens and collapses. It can also occur when two neutron stars collide.The properties of a black hole that I can recall are the mass, angular momentum and another I cannot immediately recall. The way I relate mass back to black holes is remembering that 1 kilogram of lead is the equivalent of 1 kilogram of diamond going in. Overall, the black hole increased 1 kilogram.

      " A black hole is formation of a collapsing star from a supernova explosion. It is a section in space where objects nearby get sucked inside and will never be able to come back out because of its strong gravitational pull.Black holes form when a massive star collapses in a supernova. The collapse causes the iron core of the star to shrink into neutrons. If these neutrons collide into one another and their collective mass exceeds the mass of 3kg, a black hole will form as a result of a gravitational pull.mass: the the larger the mass of the black hole is, the slower the objects near it move.Time is slowed near the black hole. The theory of general relativity supports these theories. As for space, the radii of the black hole is correlated to its mass and we can find it using the event horizon. \n",

The other cause is the colliding of two stars that exceed 3 solar massesThere are three properties: mass, volume(i think), and angular momentum.

Inside the black hole, there is an event radius, where time slows down compared to the outside environment.Super explosion of other planets; When the escape speed is larger than the speed of light, it will collapse.Black hole contains three concepts: mass, charge, and angular velocity.  Mass means that tossing 1kg of lead will produces the same effect of tossing 1kg of diamond, and we are still not sure how those different objects can affect the blackhole. Charge tells us that naturally all blackhole will be neutral instead of charged, because charged objects can repel/attract one another. And black holes cannot either attract or repel each other. Angular velocity is always conserved in our scenario. Since it is not changed, we need speed higher than light to escape the black hole. And exceeding light speed is impossible for us now.Time slows down indefinitely near the event radius/singularity of black hole. In the illustration that was provided before, we can see that while a spaceship moves normally as time goes by, another spaceship (the one near singularity) still moves despite its time slows down significantly compared to the normal/outside one. \n",

At this point, a star collapses when the gravitational pressure exceeds what the electrons in the star could hold, therefore causing a collapse and creating a black hole.One way a black hole can form is when the pressure is greater than what the electrons in the star is bounded by. This causes the pressure to increase and cause a pull in.One property of black holes is the mass. If 1 kilogram of lead is added into the black hole, then it is the same as saying that 1 kilogram of diamonds are added into the black hole. The mass of these would then be added onto the overall mass of the black hole. Black holes are not analogous to a vacuum. Black holes do not pull in objects in its surrounding vicinity easily. In fact, it is rare for passing spaceships to be pulled in by black holes. If a spacecraft gets closer to a black hole, time would slow down the more closer it is to the black hole.

      " A black hole is an object in space where time and space are regarded differently. This is because at the center of a black hole, or at the event horizon, light can not escape, and therefore no mass can escape. Whatever mass is added to the black hole, just increases the overall total mass of the black hole. To escape the black hole, a molecule would have to have a specific escape velocity. There is no current theory that explains why space and time are distorted as you get closer to the center of the black hole A black hole occurs when stars collapse in on each other. The black hole retains the amount of mass the star had when it collapsed. It occurs when the gravitation force between atoms becomes less than the force that keeps electrons together. If the black hole has less than 3 neutron stars, it is unlikely to become a black hole. If the black hole has more than 3 neutron stars, it is likely that a black hole will formThe three properties of black holes are mass, angular momentum, and electron charge. Electron charge isn't important because if the black hole is negatively charged, it will immediately become neutralized by positive charges in the universe. For mass, whatever mass is put into the black hole, will contribute to the overall mass of the black hole. Angular momentum describes the fact that the closer one gets to the center of the black hole, the faster everything spins Space and time are infinitely stretched out at the center of a black hole. Some evidence we have to support this theory, is Einstein's theory, and another theory from quantum physics. There is no current reconciliation between the two theories  \n",

      " It is thought that a black hole is the result of a supernova or collision of neuron stars. Since there is no indication from a black hole what is was before the formation of the black hole or what goes into afterward, it is difficult to determine how specific black holes form. A black hole is a very condensed star. There is so much mass in a black hole that the gravitational pull prevents everything, including light from escaping. This is why they are so difficult to study. Because of the immense gravitational pull black holes have, the closer an object gets to a black hole the more time is slowed down for that object. This concept is illustrated in Einstein's theory of relativity. Additionally, physicists cannot see inside a black hole because of the event horizon which is the point at which the gravity becomes so strong that no light can escape. It is thought that black holes form either from the collision of two neuron stars or a supernova. Although, it is difficult to say because there is no indication after the formation event, what the black hole was before. Properties of a black hole include: immense mass, conserve angular velocity and gravity. The immense mass of black hole contributes to the gravity and prevent light form escaping, additionally, the angular velocity is conserved through the mass and gravitation force in the black holeSpace and time are continuous, this is supported because as object get closer to the black hole it is as if time slows for them. \n",

Hence, scientists measure the radius based on the flat space and time, it is Schiwild Radius.Black hole is formed during supernova explosion. Usually supernova explosion would form neutron stars. They can maintain themselves if the mass do not exceed 3 solar masses. But if it exceed, they would collide and become a very small space which is a black hole. During the explosion, the gravity become stronger. Nothing can stop the crushing of gravity.Black hole have 3 properties: charge, mass and angular momentum. Charge is a unimportant properties because most of black hole would makes it neutral. Mass will decides the gravity of black hole. The heavier it is, the strong gravity it have. Angular momentum will decide how fast the black hole will rotate. It means that because the strong force of black hole, the time and space are stretched around it. They are not distinct. At a result it is impossible to measure the size of black hole. Because its strong force, the time would become slower as the prediction from the theory of relativity, which demonstrate that gravity can influence time.  \n",

      " A black hole is a hole in space that has a strong gravitational pool that is strong enough to suck in light. The gravitational pull is dependent on its mass, but they tend to be extremely strong as typically, an object would have to be faster than light if it wanted to escape its pull. Black holes form in two ways, as a result of a star death via supernova explosion or 2 neuron stars colliding. During a supernova explosion, the iron core of a star has electron degeneracy that keep the electrons in the core separate. But once the degeneracy fails and the electrons collide, a supernova explosion takes place. Regarding 2 neuron stars colliding, these neuron stars can be a result of the supernova explosion if it didn't immediately turn into a black hole. A blackhole has 3 main properties: angular momentum, mass, and charge. Charge doesn't really matter as a black hole would end up neutral at the end of the day via taking in tons of negative and positive charges, but angular momentum is the rapid spin that a blackhole does. The smaller and more collapsed a star core is, the faster the blackhole must spin. Regarding mass, the radius of a black hole depends on its mass.Einstein, using his past research, believes that space and time at the singularity of a black hole is infinitely curved as it enters singularity while quantum physics, using past research and principles, believes that space and time chaotically fluctuate as it enters singularity.  \n",

      " Black holes are a combination of space and time, where massive objects are able to exit past the speed of light. It is called \"black\" since neither light can escape from it, and \"hole\" since it is a circular hole, or vacuum, that can take in whatever is at its very closest proximity.Black holes can be formed in two ways. One way black holes are formed can be during the cycle of a dying star, whereby its inner core is eventually unable to support itself, leading various neutrons to collide together. The second way black holes are formed can result from two stars colliding against each other. These two stars are a byproduct of the previous dying star. The singularity is the center of a black hole. By approaching it, time is perceived as being slower. Unfortunately, scientists cannot measure the inside length of a singularity, but however use a Shwazenchild radius in order to determine its length, as if it were on a flat surface. The radius' length (in kilometers) is determined as the equivalent to the hole's mass-- meaning if a black hole were as large as the sun, its radius would be 3 kilometers. There is also a border line around a black hole (this border is not literal but rather figurative). Such \"border\" serves as the final point of escape, meaning if an object enters past the border, it will not be able to escape from the hole's gravitational pull. Other properties discussed can be how, according to Einstein, a black hole's singularity is theorized as being curved, while according to quantum physics, the inside of a black hole is deemed as being unstable. Finally, once an object enters a black hole, it cannot escape, and according to scientists, things which enter black hole can increase in mass by one more kilogram. Space and time at the singularity of a black hole is perceived as being slower. Evidence stems from scientist's observations.  \n",

      " A black hole is an object which is able to absorb other items that fall within its orbit due to the fact that the speed in which it would take for something to escape would be to be faster than the speed of light. As such, black holes seem to be inescapable and undeterminable to measure in its effect, especially because it is impossible to feasibly analyze how it is created or what it absorbs upon creation. Black holes form in multiple ways, the most common way being from the explosion of supernovas. The reason why is because at the expiration of a supernova, the gravity that is able to separate the layers of atoms is no longer strong enough to hold them apart, and thus the atoms fuse together into a black hole. It is also possible that when a supernova explodes, that it does not become a black hole, but instead a smaller more concentrated object. When two of these objects fuse together and outmeasure a certain level, they will form a black hole.The properties discussed were mass, charge, and angular momentum. The mass is used to calculate the radius and thus size of black holes. Charge is not a big factor to consider because if it is positively or negatively charged at creation, the black hole will likely absorb any oppositely charged particles to make it neutral. The angular momentum of the black hole is what is part of the creation process and also what makes it so fast in the inside.Space and time are four-dimensional within the singularity of a black hole, which means that within the hypothesis of a grid to define and graph space and time, instead space and time exist as spacetime together and are able to infinitely be larger within one grid space because of how the singularity of a black hole is not flat. The evidence is two of Einstein's theories: his theory of relativity and about quantum mechanics. \n",

In order to escape the pull of the black hole once you were in it, you would have to go faster than the speed of light, which is virtually impossible. Black holes can form in any ways. When the degeneracy pressure in the iron particles in the ore of a star is decreased, the nuclei can go together and lead to the collapse of the star into a black hole. Alternatively, if two star masses crash into each other, this can also create a black hole. the singularity is the center of the black hole. The event horizon is the distance from the black hole that once you pass, you will be unable to escape the hole. The radius from the \"center\" of the black hole to the event horizon is measured based on the mass of the black hole. Black holes are not charged. They have angular momentum, as they rotate while being formed. Space and time are like a grid and the gridlines are stretched out at the singularity.

Space time is the same entity around blackholes since it cures the fabric of space time so much. A black hole is formed from collapsed stars' iron core. Iron cannot be fused into other elements to provide the radiation force needed to combat the star's gradational force. Therefore, stars eventually collapse under its own gravity in a supernova. If the star is massive enough, larger than 3 solar masses, it will form a black hole after the supernova. Or if two large neutron stars collide and their cores fuse, a black hole could also form.  Important properties of black holes include charge, mass and angular momentum (rotation). Charge is relatively unimportant since a charged black hole will attract other oppositely charged particles and become a neutral black hole. Mass determines the black hole's radius. A black hole have high rotation if is from a rotating star due to conservation of angular momentum. Space and time becomes a single entity at the singularity of a black hole. If you approach a black hole's event horizon, time appear to stop for you from an outsider's perspective.

Nothing that goes in can get out, unless it travels at the speed of light. The point of no return of a black hole is called the event horizon aka Schartzchild's radius. The very middle of it is called the singularity. Black holes form from the collapse of a star when the gravity of it becomes so strong that the electron degeneracy pressure isn't able to keep the atoms apart. It can also be formed from the combination of 2 neutron stars with more than 3 units of a certain kind of force. I remember the mass, charge, shape and its effects on time. Black holes are infinitely massive or small. Throwing 1 kg of lead into it is the same as throwing 1 kg of diamonds. Because nothing can be recovered from a black hole, no one knows how to find out how it was created. Black holes can be positively or negatively charged. If it is positively charged, then it'd attract things that are negatively charged and vice versa. The event horizon is constantly curving inward as time passes.

      " Black holes are the results of stars that have gone into supernova and collapsed on themselves. They are known as black because you cannot see inside of them, and holes because they are incredibly massive and \"suck\" in other objects, like a hole.Black holes can form in two ways. Stars that go supernova can turn into black holes when their electron degeneracy pressure is weak and the star collapses in on itself. Stars can also collide into each other, which can form a black hole.Black holes have three main properties: mass, charge (neutral I believe), and angular rotation. Black holes cannot suck in objects that are far away from them (people often believe the opposite). For example, if the sun became a black hole, Earth would be too far away to be sucked in.Time moves slower as one approaches the event horizon of a black hole. If you were to watch someone go into a black hole, it would look like they stop completely and fade away. The size of a black hole is not predictable (maybe infinite), but if space was flat you can measure the radius. If a black hole was the size of the sun it would have a radius of 3 (km?). \n",

      " A black hole is an astronomical object, usually formed from the remains of a massive star, that retains enough mass to warp spacetime around it and attract objects. In particular, it has enough mass that its gravitational force is strong enough that nothing can escape from it; this is because the escape velocity to break the force of gravity is faster than the speed of light, the fastest possible speed in our universe. Light and objects can't escape from the black hole within the event horizon, which is a radius of attraction we define based on the assumption that spacetime is flat near the black hole. However, black holes's attraction manifests in warping spacetime around them, and can be thought of as pulling the gridlines of spacetime closer together near them.When a large star (usually above 10 times the mass of our Sun) reaches the end of its lifespan, the electron degeneracy pressure that sustains its iron core is no longer enough to fight against the gravitational pull of its body. So, it collapses into itself, and the more mass and the smaller the radius that remains, the stronger the gravitational pull, until the whole star has collapsed into a black hole. In the range of 3 times to 10 times the mass of our Sun, stars tend to form neutron stars instead, which are not black holes.Black holes have three intrinsic properties: mass, charge, and angular momentum. Charge is not very important, as opposite charges attract, so black holes will tend to make themselves electrically neutral. Mass and angular momentum are independent of the method of formation of the black hole, and specifically the matter that made up the precursor to the black hole.There are two competing theories of how spacetime behaves near the singularity. General relativity predicts that, because black holes warp the fabric of space and time, time spent near the singularity goes faster from the perspective of observers away from the singularity, and space will similarly contract. Quantum physics predicts, however, that space and time will be more random near the singularity. These theories have little evidence behind them, as no observations have been or can be made from inside a black hole. \n",

      " A point in space formed, often by a supernova, that is both infinitely small, and has infinite mass. Around a black hole, spacetime is curved, slowing down the relative rate at which space and time move forward. At \"the point of no return,\" we see when the angular momentum of an object in the black hole is faster than the speed of light, meaning no light, nor anything else can escape the black hole.Black holes form when a the iron core of a star burns out and compacts down, becoming smaller and smaller, until it is no longer possible to become any smaller. The mass of the black hole will be equivalent to that of the star's mass. In the center, there is an infinitely small point of infinite mass.Mass, charge, and angular momentum are the most important properties of black holes. Mass is relevant, as it is impossible to tell what is inside of the black hole from its mass, anything of the same mass inside a black hole has the exact same effect. It's radius is entirely determined by it's mass as well. Charge was relatively unimportant, as in nature, any black hole would always become neutrally charged, due to the attractiveness of opposite charges into the black hole. The angular momentum of an object approaching the black hole must always remain the same, due to the conservation of angular momentum. Because of this, things spiral into the black hole at speeds faster than the speed of light.At the singularity, space and time are not distinct, but one in the same. Space and time merge to become what is \"the fourth dimension\" and it slows down relative to the observation of an outsider. \n",

And the \"hole\" generate the idea that \"once an individual went into black hole, it's less likely for that individual to escape.\"The black holes form in the explosion of star. The explosion produce some kinds of core forces. As there are two or more collide, it forms a black hole, where there's a strong gravity originate from the core forces. However, it does not necessarily mean the explosion will generally form a black hole, given that the black hole could either form through a different process or the explosion did not generate/collide together to form a strong force. There are three properties of the black hole, including mass and angular momentum. Mass is relatively unimportant. Singularity of a black hole is the stretched infinite spacetime.

      " A black hole is an entity in space in which no light can enter, but it does not serve as any sort of vacuum. The event horizon is the point of no return, which is the boundary of the black hole, in which nothing can exit the black hole once it enters. Black holes can be formed by a star going through a supernova explosion in which the iron core becomes unstable which turns into a black hole. A supernova can also turn into neutron stars which can then collide together to form a black hole if the size is greater than 3.The three properties of black holes are mass, charge, and angular momentum. The mass of a black hole is very large and its charge is always zero. Due to the conservation of angular momentum, the black hole rotates a lot during its creation due to the rotation of the star that is turning into it. Space and time serve as a four-dimentional entity at the singularity of a black hole. A singularity is the infinite grid of spacetime leading towards the black hole. Time is much different near a black hole because time slows as you get closer to it. There is not much hard evidence to support this, but all of the theories and research show that there must be black holes.  \n",

A black hole is formed either by a star explosion (which typically happens when the iron electron force is not strong enough and other objects pull these electrons in other directions) or when neutrons with a large enough mass collide.

      " A black hole is either the result of a large star that collapsed or two neutron stars that collided. It leads all the mass to condense into an infinitely small space, and the resulting gravity is so strong that not even light can escape. The core of a star is made of iron, and the force that prevents gravity from pulling all the atoms together is the electron degeneracy force. If this force is not strong enough, gravity pulls all the atoms in, resulting in a supernova explosion which ends with a black hole. Another way black holes form is where two neutron stars collide. If their solar masses exceed 3, then a black hole will form.The boundary around a black hole is called the escape horizon. At this boundary, the escape velocity is equal to the speed of light. The size of a black hole is considered to be the radius of the black hole. But because the center of a black hole cannot be identified, and spacetime within is 4D, we calculate the size as if spacetime were flat.  It is actually highly unlikely to fall into a black hole by accident. Only objects that are close to the escape horizon will be sucked in by a black hole's gravity.  Einstein speculated that space and time curve and arc until it converges to a point. Quantum physics proposes that space and time are chaotic at the singularity. \n",

      " a black hole is a collapsed star resulting from a supernova explosion. it is named black hole due to the following: \"black\" because no light passes through its event horizon and \"hole\" because the collapsed star is infinite. the theory was of a structure that has collapsed within itself and experiences massive amounts of gravitational pull was proposed by Mitchell and Pierce. We do not know what is inside a black hole, what has fallen in, or when; which is why throwing 1 kilogram of lead in a black hole is the same as throwing 1 kilogram of diamonds in a black hole because yo will never see either substance again. to escape the event horizon of a black hole, you must be faster than the speed of light; impossible!Black holes form when two neutron stars collide against one another and are more massive than 3 solar masses. Black holes can also result from supernova explosions!Black holes consist of three properties: mass, electron degenerancy, and angular momentum. Mass because black holes are extremely massive, some infintely massive. Electron degenerancy keeps the atoms apart within the center of a black hole where you can imagine is the \"hole\" where matter falls in. Physical theories regarding angular momentum suggest a black hole rotates extremely rapidly. Space and time are not distinct properties at the singularity of a black hole. If you were watching an astronaut in the future approach the event horizon of a black hole, their 35 minutes travelling into the black hole would be comparable to 1 month, 3 months, even 6 months or more for you and \"your time.\" this means that time virtually stops at/in a black hole; our \"time\" is infinitely faster than that of a black hole.  \n",

Only velocity that's greater than the speed of light might be able to counter the gravitational pull of a black hole. Which is way any object that gets close enough to the black hole will get sucked in. The \"hole\" comes from the fact that it acts like a hole in space where scientists are unable to study and observe very well. It's just like this hole where everything that goes inside will never escape or come out. A black hole is formed in the universe when a very massive star dies and the core collapse. Another way is when two neutral stars collide, which also causes the iron core to collapse. This occurs when the electron degeneration pressure can no longer hold the atoms apart from each other in the stellar core. '-mass -electron charge -angular momentum   The size of black holes depend on the size of the original star before it went through supernova explosion. It is expected that we won't have electrically charged black holes in the future because when it is charged, it simply pulls an object of the opposite charge so it becomes neutral. Black holes have an angular momentum which causes it to rotate. It is like a ice-skater rotating on ice. Space and time are no longer individual entities, they become spacetime in a 4 dimensional area. As space and time gets closer and closer to the event horizon, they get stretched infinitely.  \n",

      " A black hole is a naturally occurring thing in space that is called \"black\" because no light reaches it, and \"hole\" because matter that falls into it is no longer observable in the universe, and can no longer come out. It is characterized by its mass, angular momentum, and electron pressure (forgot the exact term). Either from the supernova of a massive star or when there are more than 3 neutrons and the electron pressure property breaks and the atoms no longer have a force keeping them away from each other. The mass of star or neutrons become the mass of the black hole.The Schwartz(?) radius, mass, angular momentum and electron pressure (?) all help to characterize the black hole. The black hole also has a singularity and event horizon. The singularity is like the middle of the hole, the event horizon is the outer circumference. When there is an object at the event horizon, instead of the hole sucking it in like a vacuum, which is commonly believed, the object orbits there instead. Space and time are two infinite and distinct entities at the singularity of the black hole. Time slows then eventually freezes as an object moves from the event horizon nearer to the singularity of the black hole. These theories were presented by Einstein. There is no actual evidence to support these theories because physicists have yet to find a way to safely and effectively study black holes. For now, they can only use what they know based on theory and principles of physics. \n",

      " A black hole is when a supernova star and the electrons collapses at the iron core. When the mass is greater than 3 supernovas it results in a black hole. A black hole is compact. One of the first theories about black holes emerged in the 1800s by Wichelle and Palplace. Their explanation was simple and Einstein theorized that it was much more complex than that. In the passage it described two ways in which black holes can be formed. The first, is if a supernova looses the degeneracy of the electrons at the iron core, the electrons will form into a ball and it will have collapsed. The collapse may have enough strength and gravitational pull to then turn into a black hole. However, in some cases this does not immediately result in becoming a black hole. The second, the supernovas degeneracy of electrons can form a a ball of mass and not necessarily turn into a black hole. However, when 2 of these collapsed supernovas collide and the mass exceeds 3 supernovas then it will also result into a black hole. There are 3 properties of black holes (mass, electrons, angular movement).  Mass is what we described above. Mass is important because mass is what it takes for a a black hole to form. Also, if we were to throw a certain mass of an object into the black hole, and throw the same mass of a different object into the black hole it would have the same effect of  on the black hole. Mass in a black hole is infinite.  Electrical charge, which is another important aspect to black holes. If a black hole was positively charged, then it would pull things opposite of the charge to make the black hole neutral. If the black hole was negatively charged, then it would pull in things that are negatively charged, again which makes the black hole neutral.  Last is Angular movement. This is a property that is basically saying that when a black hole is forming at the core it is spinning really fast because the iron core electrons fell and it is similar to a ball.  The book provided a good example. here it goes, if an ice skater moved  her arm inward and was spinning, when she moves her arms inward  towards her core she begins to spin faster. This is the idea being explained by angular movement. As we get closer to a black hole space becomes much larger and distorted. In terms of time, time begins to be much slower. For example, in the illustration we drew there were two ships around the event horizon of the black hole. One ship If stayed consistently the same distance away from the black hole made a trip that was around 0:75. However a second chip, that was closer to the center was at around 0:38. For each of the increments after about 0:30 i believe the ship began to slow down in time when it became closer the the center of the black hole. All we have is speculation and theories about black holes at this point. It is hard to come across one by accident. And we do not really want to get too close to a black hole because there might be a point of  no return. Singularity is a term we used to describe where light and escape velocity are equal. That means that once you are there escape is pretty impossible because the speed of light is extremely fast and we have no technology that is faster than that.  \n",

      " A black hole is an entity in space where gravity is very strong, so when you enter it, you cannot escape. A black hole has an event horizon in which the escape velocity is the same as the speed of light, meaning that only things traveling faster than the speed of light can escape (which is impossible). One way black holes form is by a supernova explosion. The iron core of a star collapses when gravity outweighs the electron degeneracy pressure (this pressure separates the atoms). This causes the star to become a neutron star. If the mass of the star is 10 to 29 solar masses, it will become a black hole, where the core collapses to no end.   Another way black holes form is by two neutron stars colliding. If the total mass exceed 3 solar masses, this is enough to form a black hole. The three properties are mass, electric charge, and angular momentum.   Black holes will have the same mass and amount of gravity from the star that collapsed to form it.  Electric charge is less relevant because if the black hole was charged, it would attract the opposite charge and hence become neutral.  Due to the conservation of angular momentum, black holes will rotate if it is formed by a rotating star. Space and time are no longer distinct. Spacetime is 4D and is distorted at the singularity of a black hole, where (imaginary) grid lines would stretch forever. Einstein's theory of general relativity asserts that spacetime is infinitely stretched like a curve. Quantum physics, however, suggests that spacetime will fluctuate more and more as you go closer to the singularity.  \n",

      " A black hole is formed when a star of large mass (over 3 solar masses) collapses in on itself, unable to push back against gravity as it collapses. Once something goes inside it, it exits the observable universe and it is unknown to where it goes. The pull of gravity is so strong in the black hole that not even light can exit, giving it its distinguishable void.Black holes are formed when large stars collapse in on themselves. The integrity of the atoms that make up the star cannot hold their own against gravity pushing in on itself, expelling the electrons and leaving only the neutrons. Small stars collapse and make neutron stars, but if the star is over three solar masses large, it makes a black hole from its inability to maintain its structural integrity against the collapse.We can determine the size of a black hole by its event horizon radius and its Schwarzfeld radius. Though it's possible to estimate the circumfrence of a black hole, its true value and size is unknown because the center of the radii needed are inside the black hole; there is no way we can currently study the inside of a black hole.Spacetime is infinitely stretched and becomes one property.  \n",

      " Black hole is the point of no return. It is the creation of collapse stars during the supernova, and in order to escape the force of black hole, one must have the escape velocity faster than the speed of light which is impossible. However, saying black hole is a vacuum that sucks everything around it is false. The horizontal even surround the black hole is the boundary. If a space ship encounter the black hole in space, it will just swing around the orbital of the black hole. Only thing that pass the horizontal even can't make it out. Black hole is created by the following cases: 1. All stars have an iron cores, and they were supported by the electron degenerate force that strong enough to separate the stars from each others. However, when the electron degenerate force is not strong enough, the large stars will collapse (the supernova) into infinity small pieces and eventually created the black hole. This black hole contains all the masses of the collapsed stars. OR 2. The supernova creates neutron stars instead of a black hole during the incident. However, if the masses is smaller than 3 solar, it will create a black hole.   When one encounter a black hole in space, it is impossible to know whether it was formed by the collapse of large stars or the collide of neutron stars. Black hole contains mass, charge, and horizontal even  The mass of the black hole is all the masses of the collapsed stars that create it. Tossing 1kg of lead into the black hole is equivalent to 1kg of diamond. The weight of a black hole is about 3kg of the sun. If the black hole is 10x larger than the sun, it will have the weight of 30kg solar.   Charge - in nature, black hole is neutral. The case of a charged black hole is unlikely to happen   Horizontal even is the boundary between the black hole and its surrounding. Horizontal even is the point of no return, because in order to escape the black hole when one passes the horizontal even, one must be travel faster than the speed of light, which is impossible.

      " A black hole consists of a supernova explosion in which a star's atoms no longer have the pressure in which holds them together which causes the black hole and its properties. This black hole size can be estimated by measuring from the center of its core to the event horizon (the boundary where the pull begins and the normal gravity ends). Three key components to black holes is mass, charge, and time. Black holes form when the atoms within the supernova collapse in which there is no pressure that holds these forces together. This causes a lot of energy which creates changes in gravitational pull. Having this change captures things into its event horizon and get attracted into the singularity.The three properties of black holes include mass, time, and charge. The charge of a black hole is neutral. As mass increases and is pulled closer, the singularity gets pulled in deeper. Time slows down as you get closer to the singularity. An example given is if someone is watching something get closer and closer to the center of the singularity, the object will appear as if it is slowing down, then it will seem like it stopped and then will slowly disappear into the darkness. Time relatively slows down as you get closer to the middle and space cannot be completely measure only estimated.

They also have angular momentum because it's conserved from the collapse of the star. Time moves slower as you approach a black hole. Black holes attract objects of whatever object would make it neutral. Mass of objects that fall in is absorbed by black holes.Space and time are four dimensional and not separate entities. because of the mass of the black hole time moves more slowly as you approach. The distance between time and space is infinite because it has been stretched in a singularity. \n",

The first is the collapse of a star into itself due to insufficient electron degeneracy pressure to act against the gravitational force, creating a heavy core of neutrons and the black hole. If multiple neutron cores combine, they may form another type of star, which then could collapse into itself if the cores collided with one another. In a similar manner, the heavy neutron core is formed, along with a black hole.The black hole has three main properties: Mass, charge and angular momentum. The center boundary of no return, where the escape velocity equals the speed of light, is called the event horizon. The smaller the size of the black hole, the faster the angular velocity must be. The black hole is called black because as light cannot escape, that is the color it appears. Space and time stretch out seemingly infinitely.

As the mass is infinitely high in an infinitely small space spacetime is curved, exerting a really high gravitational pul on anything that crosses the event horizon (escape velocity bigger than speed of light).When the force that keeps atoms in place becomes higher than the mass of the iron core, stars collapse forming a black hole (implode causing a supernova). Black holes can also be formed if more than 3 Neutron stars (formed after they burn their core) collied with one another.The escape velocity is higher than the speed of light. They have a neutral charge since they do not seem to attract either anions or cations. Their mass is related to the radius measured in the event horizon since past this point the observable universe ends and we cannot make any measurements. Their masses are infinitely greater compared to the small space they occupy. They exert an immense gravitational pull on everything, objects that are closed to it orbiting around it while objects that pass the event horizon are drawn into it. Due to Einstein's Theory of Relativity if someone watched a person approach a black hole they would see that person moving slower.Space and time are two different entities in the singularity, making it warped in four-dimensional spacetime. Time and space can both be measured by grid lines where the distance between each gridline is infinite making the time and space needed to reach the next grid line in the singularity infinite.

The larger the mass gravitational pull is of an object, the slower time appears. The evidence we have to support these theories are relative in how Sun's come to exist and die. These theories are also relative to what we already know about the physics of our Sun. However, we do not have solid evidence that truly supports how black holes came to be, because we are fairly far from the technology that could reach a black hole and examine it properly because the mass is both indefinitely large and small.

Light is unable to escape from the black hole as well due to the speed of light being less than the escape velocity of the black hole at the event horizon; this is why black holes are named \"black holes\" as we cannot view them because no photos can escape.Black holes form when the iron core of a star collapses. This collapse occurs when the electron force that stops nearby atoms from merging is too weak to stop the collapse. This happens during a supernova. Not all supernovae result in black holes; sometimes neutron stars are formed. When 2 or more neutron stars with a combined mass of at least 3 solar masses collide, a black hole can also be formed. If the neutron stars are not massive enough, a black hole will not form.Black holes are infinitely dense. Black holes have angular momentum as the stars that they formed from also had angular momentum. The measurement of a black hole's event horizon is called the Schwarzenchild radius, which is the radius of the black hole's event horizon if spacetime were flat and not infinitely stretched around a black hole.  Black holes do not \"suck\" objects; they are fairly easy to avoid and will typically only exert a mild gravitational pull unless one is very close to the black hole. If the Sun were replaced with a black hole, Earth would not get pulled into the black hole. There are 2 theories about space and time at the singularity of a black hole. General relativity suggests that time slows down as spacetime gets infinitely stretched. Quantum mechanics suggests a different explanation. It's hard to gather evidence about black holes because we can't directly observe them. \n",

      " A Black Hole is the result of a star collapsing. It does not take things into it, it rather only brings things into itself if they get really close to it. Once an item gets this close to a black hole, it would have to travel at speeds faster than light to escape. we do not know what happens when items go into black holes. They form as mass increases and changes the space-time continuum. It has to do with neuron and star collisions i think. I remember that black holes slow down the time of items that enter it until they virtually stop. If someone was to watch this happen, they would see the object just fade into the black hole. Being put in place of the sun would not suck the earth or any other planets into its orbit. We don't know what happens after items go into the black hole. I do not know the evidence, but I do know that time is different and completely stops. This is unlike anywhere else that we know in the universe.  \n",

      " A black hole is called black because no light can escape its entity and is called a hole because it just keeps expanding. The black hole is basically when stars collapsed due to the charges no longer able keep the atoms separated hence a super nova happens; however, sometimes when the super nova happens it may not lead to a black hole. Another reason for the black hole to form is when 2 stars collapse and the mass is bigger than it can handle hence a black hole forms as well. When the black hole is formed there is no way to tell whether it was because of the lack of separation from atoms or because of the 2 stars colliding and collapsing due to a larger mass.  Some important properties of black holes is the escape velocity which is when, at the event horizon, the escape velocity is equal to that of the speed of light. This means that objects at the event horizon must travel faster than light to escape the pull of the black hole, which is quite impossible. Another property is angular moment that plays a factor in the speed of rotation for the black hole, similar to that of a ice skater. Space and time at the singularity of a black hole is that at the event horizon, time may still seem the same; however, as an object gets closer to the black hole and gets pulled deeper, time seems to slow down. So, the time outside of the black hole may seem to travel a lot faster than that of the object being pulled in. What other evidence that support the singularity of the black hole is Einsteins relativity theory.  \n",

      " It is a very large mass that is condensed to an infinitely small volume. Its escape velocity is higher than the speed of light. The event horizon is the edge of the black hole, and the singularity is the center of the black hole. In the singularity, spacetime is curved to the point where it seems as if time does not move in it. A black hole can occur in two ways: when a star's neuron degeneracy pressure is no longer strong enough to counteract the gravitational pull of the iron atoms in the core, or when two neutron stars collide and consequent mass collapses. If the two neutron stars collide and have a mass larger than 3 solar masses, it will collapse and create a black hole. There are three important properties of black holes: mass, charge, and angular momentum. The mass of a black hole determines the gravitational force of the black hole and the Schwarzchild radius. The charge determines the type of objects the black hole will absorb. Negatively charged black holes will attract positively charged objects in order to nullify the charge. The black hole maintains its angular momentum from when it was a star, so it will rotate faster than when it was a star. Spacetime curves as it approaches the singularity of the black hole. The theories of general relativity and quantum physics describe the phenomenon, but in contradictory ways.  \n",

      " It is the aftermath of a supernova, what occurs when the EDG of a star isn't strong enough to support the atoms at its core and it collapses. It has no light and nothing within it is observable, and things that come close to it can become absorbed. They form when the EDG of a star's core can no longer support the atoms within it from being separate, and the core collapses. Sometimes this results in smaller stars that contain collapsed cores, but if these stars collide they can form black holes as well. There is a specific distance from black holes from which objects will be absorbed called the event horizon, and objects don't get swept into black holes unless they are very close. Black holes contain no light and are not observable within them. There is no distinction between space and time, and this causes time to slow down as something gets absorbed into a black hole. According to einstein's theory, the event horizon causes a curving of space, but according to quantum physics, there is a zig-zagging of space.  \n",

      " A black hole is a collapsed star, which its iron core can no longer withstand the gravity and causes a supernova. It can also result from neutron stars colliding together. It is a spinning massive entity that can suck things in, and not even light can escape it.Either from a star exploding and becoming a supernova (from the iron core not being able to withstand the gravity) or  neutron stars colliding into each other.A black hole is described by its mass, charge, and angular momentum. The charge is relatively unimportant, because for example, a negatively charged black hole would attract something positive to neutralize the charge. The radius is determined by it mass, thus if a black hole is the size of the sun, the radius would be around 3 kilometers. contrary to popular belief, it doesn't suck things in that are far away, but you have to be really close to be sucked in. If a space ship were to fly near it, it would just go around in an ordinary orbit. The event horizon is the imaginary line that separates the inside of the black hole from the outside. The angular momentum is the spinning. The smaller , the more angular momentum (ice skater example) as the hole's core spins in tighter.Einstein explained that time and space would curve to a point into infinity. Quantum physics explained that time and space would be a lot more chaotic at the singularity.  Evidence: as you approach the event horizon, time slows down, and it seemingly stops at the event horizon \n",

The force of the gravitational pull of that star pushes down continually on the mass of the core until it is too small to be seen. Magnitude, radius, electric charge. The radius of the black hole is based on the gravitational pull of the star. I think that magnitude and electric charge were mentioned but I am not sure if they were the properties of the black holes. I did not comprehend or remember enough about the properties to confidently explain how they relate to black holes. At the singularity of the black hole time time slows down the closer you get to it.

      " A black hole is the byproduct of a supernova. This occurs when the star's electron degeneracy pressure can no longer withstand the gravitational forces of the atoms in the core. As a result, the core collapses as the atoms get closer together. This collapse causes the mass of the star to be compressed into an infinitely small space. It can also form when two neutron stars collide and exceed 3 solar masses, which would then cause them to collapse. These celestial phenomena have very dense cores that have a massive amount of gravitational force when it gets closer to the Event Horizon.Black holes form from the collapse of a star's iron core, as a result of a supernova, which is the result of a lack in electron degeneracy pressure that cannot withstand the gravitational forces acting between the atoms. As the atoms continue to condense together into an infinitely small space, it forms a rapidly spinning black hole. The spinning is caused by the conservation of angular momentum. Another way they can form is from the collision of 2 neutron stars. If the 3 neutron stars collide and exceed 3 solar masses, then the core would collapse and undergo the same process as mentioned before.I remember that mass was an important property mentioned in the passage when it was mentioned that the mass of the star that the black hole formed from is condensed into an infinitely small space, which causes an increase in density, while maintaining the same gravitational forces exerted from the star it formed from (depending on how close you are to the event horizon). Another important property was angular momentum, which helps explain why black holes spin so rapidly. According to the conservation of angular momentum, angular momentum is always conserved. Since the mass did not change, the decrease in size caused a massive increase in angular velocity. The last property that was mentioned was electric charge, which they thought was not as important because if a black hole had a positive or negative net charge, it would attract objects of the opposite charge and neutralize its electric potential.As one gets closer to the event horizon, time slows down significantly. According to Einstein's Theory of General Relativity, a large mass begins to alter time and space as one gets closer. He also mentioned that space curves infinitely within a black hole. There is not much evidence that we have currently other than the support of these theories. \n",
