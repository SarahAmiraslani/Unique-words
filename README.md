# Unique-words
This code calculates the number of words in a cell without double counting repeated words. For example, if the word "the" is mentioned 3 times in the cell, this will add +1 to the word count (not + 3). The code accounts for differences in capitalization and use of punctuation, but does not account for spelling mistakes. Therefore, if "the" and "thee" are written in a cell, this would add +2 to the word count. This is an elementary attempt to measure unique ideas mentioned in a cell and should be improved to account for spelling mistakes.
